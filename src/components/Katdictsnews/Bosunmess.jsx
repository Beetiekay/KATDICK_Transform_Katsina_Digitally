        <p className='text-xs dark:text-gray mb-2'>Good Morning, Katsina</p>

        <p className='text-xs dark:text-gray mb-3'>
          This is my second visit to your beautiful state in just three weeks-and it is not by accident.
        </p>

        <p className='text-xs dark:text-gray mb-3'>
           It is based on deep conviction.
        </p>

        <p className='text-xs dark:text-gray mb-3'>
           Because when look at Katsina, and indeed the entire Arewa region, I do not just see land. see promise. 
        </p>

        <p className='text-xs dark:text-gray mb-3 '>
           Arewa is blessed -richly blessed. With land that can feed nations, with young minds that can power industries, and with a heritage that speaks of greatness. 
        </p>

        
        <p className='text-xs dark:text-gray mb-3 '>
           But more importantly, see a people ready to build.
        </p>

        <p className='text-xs dark:text-gray mb-3 '>
          When we started Nigeria's first tech innovation hub-CCHUB-in a modest space in Yaba, we had only one conviction: that Nigerians could build world-class solutions if given the right environment.
        </p>

        <p className='text-xs font-semibold dark:text-green opacity-85 dark:opacity-60 mb-3 '>
         That small hub became the birth place of some of Africa's most remarkable technology Success stories: 
        </p>

        <p className='text-xs dark:text-gray mb-3 '>
         •Andela ran it's very first software engineering training inside CcHub-long betore it became a global model for remote tech talent.
        </p>

        <p className='text-xs dark:text-gray mb-3 '>
         •Flutterwave carried out its early product testing at CcHub-before it scaled into one of Africas biggest fintech giants.
        </p>

        <p className='text-xs dark:text-gray mb-3 '>
         •BudglT, now a leader in civic tech and budget transparency across the continent, started right there.
        </p>

        <p className='text-xs dark:text-gray mb-3 '>
         • So did LifeBank, the lifesaving health logistics company.
        </p>

        <p className='text-xs dark:text-gray mb-3 '>
         And many others.
        </p>

        <p className='text-xs dark:text-gray mb-3 '>
         Today. CcHUB has grown into Africas largest innovation network acquiring iHUBin Kerya, and expanding to Rwanda, Namibia, and Togo.
        </p>

        <p className='text-xs dark:text-gray mb-3 '>
         But it all started with one simple idea, in one building, with one community.
        </p>

        <p className='text-xs dark:text-gray mb-3 '>
         And l share this because believe without any doubt- that the next great wave of African startups can start here in Katsina. 
        </p>

        <p className='text-xs dark:text-gray mb-3 '>
         What we built in Yaba can be built in Zaria, in Minna, in Sokoto, in Maiduguri -it we dare to try. 
        </p>

        <p className='text-xs dark:text-gray mb-3 '>
         Technology is no longer just a sector. It is the foundation for buiding a productive, inclusive, and prosperous Nigeria.
        </p>

        <p className='text-xs dark:text-gray mb-3 '>
         In agricuture, we can double yields using Al and digital tools to guide farmers in Daura, Funtua or Bauchi. 
        </p>

        <p className='text-xs dark:text-gray mb-3 '>
         in finance, fintech has already brought millions into the formal economy, and we are just scratching the surface.
        </p>

        <p className='text-xs dark:text-gray mb-3 '>

        </p>

        <p className='text-xs dark:text-gray mb-3 '>
         You don't need to wait for permission. You are the permission.

         A nation where being born in Katsina or Kano is not a disadvantage, but a strategic advantage. 
        </p>

        <p className='text-xs dark:text-gray mb-3 '>
         Where innovation has no postcode and the future belongs to those bold enough to create it. 
        </p>

        <p className='text-xs dark:text-gray mb-3 '>
         So l ask you today:
        </p>

        <p className='text-xs dark:text-gray mb-3 '>
         Will you rise with us? Will you build with us?
        </p>

        <p className='text-xs dark:text-gray mb-3 '>
         Because the future of Nigeria - the future of Africa-is not being written in Silicon Valley.It is being written right here, right now, in Katsina. 
        </p>

        <p className='text-xs dark:text-gray mb-3 '>
